    <p>
        Khichdi is a classic Indian comfort food made from rice and lentils, 
        gently spiced and often cooked with vegetables. It's simple, nutritious, 
        easy to digest, and widely considered a healing or “sattvic” dish, often eaten 
        when one is unwell or in need of a light, wholesome meal. Depending on the region,
        khichdi can range from plain to richly spiced, soft or fluffy, and is often 
        served with curd, papad, or pickle.
